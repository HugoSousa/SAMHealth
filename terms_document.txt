To get terms of a specific document (example P003_3):
http://localhost:8983/solr/samh/tvrh?q=*%3A*&fl=text&fq=id:P003_3
[needs TermVectorComponent in solrconfig.xml and respective field in schema.xml]


To get terms of every document (and respective document frequency):
http://localhost:8983/solr/samh/terms?terms.fl=text&terms.limit=-1


The returned tokens are the indexed ones, which means they've been previously analysed and tokenized by Solr.
For example, it returns "moment" instead of "momento" or "momentaneamente".
